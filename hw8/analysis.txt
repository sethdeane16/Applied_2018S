To choose the appropriate correction function, hw8 was run with different
order equations. The most closely correlated norm of residuals, R**2
determination coefficient and pearson correlation was found in the second
order equation. It was observed that with order 8 polynomials, ge produced
values that were further from the accepted value and norm returned nan for
all values of the coefficients of the correction function.

Apart from the 8th order polynomial Norm and ge options gave the same values
for the correction polynomial. Some of these data analysis values are shown
below.

order 2
-------
norm = 3481.706
R**2 = .912121
pear = .998917

order 3
-------
norm = 20949.49
R**2 = .7785
pear = .990400

R**2 = .81715
pear = .994242
