General program format:
This homework involved the solving of different polynomials using laguerres 
algorithm. If a polynomial has 1 root, it is solved and printed. If a
polynomial has 2 roots, they are solved with the quadratic function. If the
polynomial has any number of roots above 2, they are solved for using
laguerres and the polynomial is deflated until there is a quadratic
remaining. At this point, the quadratic equation is used to solve the for the
 remaining roots.

How derivatives are calculated:
Derivatives are calculated by subtracting and dividing the power of each term
 sequentially.

Reading in files:
Data is read in line by line from a file containing a space separated list of
numbers. These numbers are ordered from high to low of the coefficients to a
polynomial. Each line is read in then parsed and passed to the function that
will calculate the roots of the function.

Troubles and Learning experiences:
This lab presented a lot of memory management trouble for me. Returning a
reference to a pointer could not be done by using the & modifier. Instead, 
you had to malloc space for it then return that and make sure to free it 
outside of the function. I gained lots of knowledge about how to debug memory
issues. Valgrind is great, and always make sure to close the file.
