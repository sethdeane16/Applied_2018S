Development Updates:
A row swapping helper function was written for easier row swapping. This 
function also updates the permutation vector. Functions were added to find
the upper and lower triangular forms for easy forward and backward
substitution.

ge1.txt-ge4.txt result analysis:
ge1.txt results is a solvable matrix. This file did not have any parsing 
challenges.
ge2.txt results is a solvable matrix. This file did not have any parsing
challenges.
ge3.txt results in a non-solvable matrix. This file did have some parsing
challenges with whitespace.
ge4.txt results in a non-solvable matrix. This file did have some parsing
challenges with whitespace, tabs and newlines.

Timings:
Itt | my solutions | GSL solution
----|--------------|-------------
1   | 8.45 sec     | 7.74 sec
2   | 8.50 sec     | 7.98 sec
3   | 8.66 sec     | 7.95 sec
4   | 8.48 sec     | 7.92 sec
5   | 8.48 sec     | 7.82 sec
---------------------------------
avg | 8.54 sec     | 7.88 sec

The performance metric as calculated by dividing the time taken for my
solution by the time taken for the GSL solution is 1.0837. This timing does
include the time taken to read in the matrix. Reading the file was done the
same for each matrix which may have increased the times taken to calculate
significantly.
