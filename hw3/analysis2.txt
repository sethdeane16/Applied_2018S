NOTE: values are in seconds
NOTE: data is collected from running data.txt
NOTE: MODIFIED CODE FOR INCREASED SPEED
FORMAT: total time -> time per repetition.

All values collected are presented in seconds. Data was collected from
data.txt. There were some improvements made or attempted in the code. These
improvements are detailed below...

Improvements made to input:
  - Increased the size of the malloc from 1 to 200000. This allows for less
    malloc commands which are very costly.
Improvements made to calculations:
  - Tried unrolling the loop, but that appeared to have a negative impact.
  - Tried converting from double to int but this created incorrect results.
    and still took as long as the double version.

The data to the left of the arrow is the total time taken to run the test,
the information to the right of the arrow is the time taken per repetition.


hw3opt.c
===================================
SPEED:
-----------
Data Input with 1000 repetitions:
    1) 4.36 -> 4.36E-3
    2) 4.34 -> 4.34E-3
    3) 4.42 -> 4.42E-3
    4) 4.38 -> 4.38E-3
    5) 4.29 -> 4.29E-3

Calculations with 2.5E6 repetitions:
    1) 80.56 -> 3.23E-5
    2) 80.47 -> 3.24E-5 
    3) 80.54 -> 3.24E-5 
    4) 80.62 -> 3.23E-5
    5) 80.51 -> 3.24E-5

SIZE:
-----------
The size of hw3opt.c (with timing) is 8006 bytes. The program created by this
source code is 14999 bytes. These results were obtained using the ls -l
command. The size -A command was then run. The results of the command
size -A hw3opt were...
.text = 2936
.data = 4
.bss  = 24


From this analysis data, by optimizing the c program, it was made faster at
the expense of code size.
