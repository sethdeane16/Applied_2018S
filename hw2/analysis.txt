Question 2:
Running the debug command "gdb -args debugTst divide" opens gdb. After
running (by pressing r then enter) the program crashes on line 24. Rerunning
gdb, the first command done is "b 24" which creates a breakpoint before line
24. Running the program will then stop at the breakpoint. At this point,
running "print number" returns that number which equals 100. 

Question 3:
When running the valgrind command on debugTst with argument "memory", 2048
bytes are definitely lost in 1 block. When running the valgrind command on
debugTst with argument "good" there were no memory leaks possible. The amount
of memory used and freed during the program was 2096 bytes.

Question 4-5:
A Dynamic Array program was written. It will expand if the amount of data
entered in the array becomes larger than the array. This dynamic memory
allocation was done using malloc, realloc and free commands. When reading in 
the file to the array, each line must be less than 255 bytes in length,
otherwise an error will be returned. At the end of the program, if no errors
occurred then an error code of 0 will be returned.
